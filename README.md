# db-connection-pooling-deamon

Is a daemon that allows usage of pooling database connections via RESTful API for languages/frameworks that dont have such capabilities.  
Initially it supports postgres. MySQL and other databases are work in progress.

This is for sure not finished and production-ready code!

## How to use:

- config config.yml
- build and run the daemon
- call it's `/query` url with json structured as follows:
```json
{  
  "query": "SELECT * from test where name = $1 and lastname = $2",  
  "params": ["jack", "black"]  
}
```

## TODO:
- jwt/basic auth authentification
- mysql support
- add more tests
- refactor code to make it more idiomatic
